HabitAllowance

Lately I've been trying to build new habits by rewarding myself when I complete a routine. I set a monetary reward for each routine completed, and I keep a running total to use for spending money. I've been tracking this on a spreadsheet, and I'm to the point where I'd prefer to make an app that tracks all of this for me, as well as an excuse to try out the latest version of blazor.
